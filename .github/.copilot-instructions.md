# Copilot Instructions

## Knowledge Graph First

This workspace uses **TSKB** to document architecture as queryable knowledge graphs.

**Before navigating code:** Check `docs/*/dist/*.json` for architectural context.

- Search nodes (folders, modules, exports, terms, docs)
- Follow edges to trace dependencies and references
- Use `resolvedPath` to locate actual files
- Read `nodes.docs` for architectural explanations

**Only fall back to code search when:**

- Graph doesn't exist or is outdated
- Need implementation details (graph shows structure, not code)

## Path Conventions

- All paths in graphs are relative to tsconfig baseDir/rootDir
- Use forward slashes `/` (cross-platform)
- Paths must be portable across repos and machines

## Updating Documentation

- When changing architecture: update `.tskb.tsx` files
- Rebuild graph: `npm run generate` in the relevant docs folder
- Keep vocabulary (Folders/Modules/Terms/Exports) synchronized with code
