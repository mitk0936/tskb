# TaskFlow App

This is a demonstration boilerplate application used to showcase the **tskb** (Task Knowledge Base) documentation system.

## Purpose

This codebase serves as a reference example and is **not meant to be built or run**. It provides a realistic application structure that is documented using tskb files.

## Documentation

The architectural documentation for this application is located in [`docs/taskflow-app/`](../../docs/taskflow-app/). The tskb files describe:

- System architecture and design decisions
- Component relationships and data flow
- Authentication patterns
- API constraints and service isolation
- Repository patterns and data layer design

To explore the documentation, navigate to the [`docs/taskflow/`](../../docs/taskflow/) directory and review the `.tskb.tsx` files or run the generation scripts to produce visualization outputs.

## About tskb

tskb allows developers to document complex applications using TypeScript/TSX syntax, making architectural knowledge more accessible and maintainable alongside the code.
