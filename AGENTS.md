# CLAUDE.md

**MANDATORY FIRST ACTION**:
Read this before querying the codebase: [AGENTS.md](./.tskb/AGENTS.md)

AGENTS.md contains the complete TSKB workflow and explains why you must use it before reading source files.

**If you start ANY work without first reading AGENTS.md, STOP. Read it now.**
